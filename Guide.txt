Attendly - Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to deploy your self-hosted Attendly Time Clock system. The process takes approximately 15-20 minutes.

Phase 1: Configure Your Google Sheet (10 Mins)
This sheet will act as your database.

1.1 Create a New Google Sheet

Go to sheets.google.com.

Create a new blank spreadsheet.

Rename it to something memorable, like "Attendly Time Clock Data".

1.2 Set Up the "Employee Database" Tab

Rename the default "Sheet1" tab to Employee Database.

In cell A1, type Employee Name.

In cell B1, type DOB (YYYY-MM-DD).

Add your employee details starting from row 2.

1.3 Set Up the "Attendance Log" Tab

Click the + icon to add a new sheet.

Rename this new sheet to Attendance Log.

Set up the following headers in row 1:

A1: Employee Name

B1: Date

C1: Punch In Time

D1: Punch Out Time

E1: Total Hours

F1: Status

1.4 Get Your Spreadsheet ID

Look at the URL in your browser's address bar.

The ID is the long string of characters between /d/ and /edit.

.../spreadsheets/d/1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ/edit...

Copy this ID and save it somewhere safe. You'll need it in the next phase.

Phase 2: Deploy the Google Apps Script (10 Mins)
This script is the backend that powers your time clock.

2.1 Create a New Script Project

Go to script.google.com.

Click New project.

Give the project a name, like "Attendly Backend API".

2.2 Add the Backend Code

Delete any existing code in the Code.gs file.

Open the google-apps-script.js file provided.

Copy its entire content and paste it into the script editor.

Crucially: Find the line const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE'; and replace YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE with the ID you copied in step 1.4.

2.3 Run the Initializer (Optional but Recommended)

In the script editor, find the function dropdown menu at the top.

Select the initializeSheet function.

Click Run.

A popup will ask for authorization. Follow the steps to grant the script permission to access your Google Sheets.

You may need to click "Advanced" and "Go to (unsafe)" to proceed. This is normal because the app was created by you.

2.4 Deploy as a Web App

Click the blue Deploy button and select New deployment.

Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose Web app.

Configure the deployment:

Description: Attendly Time Clock API v1.0

Execute as: Me (your@email.com)

Who has access: Anyone (This is required for the public-facing webpage to communicate with it).

Click Deploy.

Important: Copy the generated Web app URL. This is the link between your frontend and backend.

Phase 3: Configure and Launch the Frontend (5 Mins)
3.1 Update the Frontend File

Open the index.html file in a text editor.

Find the line: const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';

Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE with the Web app URL you copied in step 2.4.

Save the file.

3.2 Test Locally

Drag the modified index.html file into your web browser.

The employee dropdown should load.

Perform a test punch-in and punch-out. Check your Google Sheet to see if the data appears in the "Attendance Log".

3.3 Deploy the Live Website

You can now host the index.html file anywhere. For a free and easy solution, use Netlify Drop or GitHub Pages. Simply upload the final index.html file to get a live, shareable URL for your employees.

Congratulations! Your Attendly Time Clock system is now fully operational.
